## Social project for IvyHacks
### 1. Vaishnavi Gopalakrishnan
### 2. Sri Harsha Varma Konda

### 1. Creativity: How original is the hack?
Our idea is to create a web page that will offer several adventure trips like water rafting, hiking, kayaking, camping. It will provide the adventurers to find others who like to do the same, find events and register or unregister for the same. The value of this application is to create a social network for people who love adventures.

### 2. Depth: How well does the hack solve the stated problem?
We assume there is no seperate platform for these adventure trips or events.

### 3. Design and Usability: Is the hack designed to most optimally solve the stated problem? 
This our first hackathon to submit a project. We tried our best to submit our optimal solution.

### 4. Potential: Is the hack scalable for the future?
Scalable for the future. We can add more on the below;
#### Live chat
#### Rate past events
#### Follow other adventurers 
and more...

### 5. Presentation and Demo: Was the problem area clearly indicated and the hack well demonstrated?
We assume that our project is for "Connectivity" track
